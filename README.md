# COVID-19-and-The-Film-Industry
Comparison of certain aspects of the film industry before and after the pandemic had started.

My university project from around December 2021, which I thought I'd share. The Jupyter Notebook contains a step-by-step explanation of collecting, cleaning and analysing data.
The posed research quesions were:
* Were Box Office revenues before the pandemic siginificantly different from after the Covid outbreak had started?
* Which genres were the most popular before and during the pandemic?
* Were films from before the pandemic better or worse, according to the IMDb scores?
